– Networking & Firewalls for DevSecOps
🧠 Module Theory: Networking Fundamentals in DevSecOps
Networking is at the heart of how systems communicate — and how attackers move.

In a modern DevSecOps environment, your responsibilities go far beyond writing security group rules. You must understand how networks are structured, how to segment access by role and workload, and how to detect or prevent lateral movement between services.

This week we’ll explore:

How DevSecOps applies network segmentation, firewalls, and least-privilege access

How tools like iptables, ufw, and cloud-native firewalls (e.g., AWS SGs/NACLs, K8s Network Policies) enforce these boundaries

How vulnerable or over-permissive rules can be exploited in real attacks

🎯 Objectives
By the end of this module, you will:

Understand and apply core networking concepts: IP, TCP/UDP, ports, DNS

Set up a host-based firewall using ufw or iptables

Simulate and block lateral movement between two app services

Visualize traffic and access attempts using logs and CLI tools

Define baseline rules for environment isolation in ECS and Kubernetes

Understand Zero Trust principles in DevSecOps networking

📦 Application Tie-In: Evolving the Project
This week, we simulate breaking the monolith into two isolated parts:

A backend service (Python API) and a frontend (Node.js)

They live on the same Linux VM but must be isolated by:

User access

Firewall ports

Execution context (systemd or containers)

You will:

Expose only the frontend (port 3000)

Block public access to the backend (port 5000)

Allow frontend → backend communication only

Verify this using tools like curl, ss, ufw, iptables, and logs

Later in ECS/Kubernetes, these concepts evolve into Service Connect, SGs, and NetworkPolicies — this is your foundation.

🔧 Tools & Technologies
TCP/IP stack

nmap, ss, netstat, ufw, iptables

curl, telnet, nc

Linux system logs

Optional: tcpdump, wireshark (for packet capture exploration)

🛡️ DevSecOps Concepts Introduced
Concept	Relevance
Network Segmentation	Limit lateral movement between services
Port & Protocol Control	Prevent accidental exposure (e.g., dev DB open to internet)
Principle of Least Network Access	“Need to talk” basis between microservices
Ingress/Egress Boundaries	Who can reach what, and from where
Auditing and Logging	Detect unauthorized scans or attempts
📁 Deliverables
Two services (frontend and backend) deployed and network-isolated on the same VM

Host-based firewall rules that enforce correct access paths

Evidence of rejected vs. accepted connections (e.g., curl output, logs)

A network-policy.md file explaining current state + assumptions

Prep for Week 3 where we’ll containerize both services securely
