# Challenge Lab â€“ Week 1

### ðŸ§ª Scenario:
You are part of a platform engineering team.

1. Your task is to:
   - Add a `README.md` file to the repo
   - Create a `devops-notes.md` in a new branch called `feature/docs`
   - Add 3 commits:
     - Add initial outline
     - Add Git basics
     - Add DevOps 5W1H
   - Rebase your branch on `main`
   - Push and open a pull request
   - Enable branch protection

2. ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
   - Use at least one **rebase**
   - Use **Squash & Merge**
   - Avoid force-pushing to main
