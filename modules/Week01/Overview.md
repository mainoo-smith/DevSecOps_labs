– Linux & OS Fundamentals for DevSecOps
🧠 Module Theory: Why Linux and OS Concepts Matter in DevSecOps
In DevSecOps, security starts from the ground up. The operating system is the foundation upon which your CI/CD tools, containers, microservices, and cloud infrastructure all run.

While DevOps often emphasizes automation and pipelines, DevSecOps demands awareness of what's happening under the hood — how permissions work, how processes behave, what file ownership means, and how attackers might exploit insecure configurations.

You’ll also encounter real-world cases where container escapes, privilege escalations, or insecure SSH setups were entry points for attackers. Knowing how to secure the OS and understand its audit signals is non-negotiable.

🎯 Objectives
By the end of this module, you will:

Understand core Linux OS concepts that impact security:

Users, groups, permissions, processes, file hierarchy

SUID/SGID/sticky bits, chroot, sudo, SSH hardening

Set up a secure Linux-based environment for your evolving DevSecOps app

Build the first layer of your DevSecOps-friendly development VM

Apply OS-level hardening techniques used in production environments

📦 Application Tie-In: Evolving the Project
This week, we start the project from the bottom:

Provision the initial development and deployment VM

Create an isolated Linux user that will run the application and CI/CD agents

Prepare the directory structure where the "Notes App" microservices will live

Set file and execution permissions based on least privilege principles

As the app evolves, this VM/instance will:

Host Git runners and deploy services (early)

Later be containerized and deployed to ECS/K8s (week 6+)

Serve as a runtime hardening sandbox (week 12+)

🔧 Tools & Technologies
Linux (Ubuntu/Debian-based VM or EC2)

SSH, Bash

chmod, chown, sudo, groups, ps, top

Optional: ufw, fail2ban, auditd, lynis
