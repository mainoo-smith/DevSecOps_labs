– Hardening a Linux DevSecOps Environment (Step-by-Step)
🛠️ Objective
Set up and harden a Linux virtual machine (VM) or EC2 instance that will serve as the base for your secure DevSecOps application lifecycle. This includes:

Creating a secure user

Locking down SSH access

Hardening file permissions

Auditing running processes

Preparing for future CI/CD and service deployment

🧰 Prerequisites
A local Linux VM (e.g., via VirtualBox/Vagrant) or an EC2 instance running Ubuntu 22.04+

Your terminal with SSH or console access

Root or sudo privileges

1. 🏗️ Create a Dedicated DevSecOps User
🔒 We'll avoid using root for any DevOps activity.
Instead, we create devsecops as a non-root user with least privilege.

sudo adduser devsecops
Follow the prompts. Choose a strong password and secure shell.

# Add user to sudo (but we will restrict later)
sudo usermod -aG sudo devsecops

# Confirm
id devsecops
2. 📂 Prepare Directory Structure for App Deployment
We’ll begin preparing folders for our monorepo/microservices.

sudo mkdir -p /opt/notestream/{frontend,backend,automation,infra}
sudo chown -R devsecops:devsecops /opt/notestream
sudo chmod -R 750 /opt/notestream
750 means: Owner can read/write/execute, group can read/execute, others have no access.

3. 🔐 Lock Down SSH Access
SSH is a primary attack vector. Harden it immediately.

✅ 3.1 Disable root SSH login
Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config:

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Update or add the following lines:

PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
AllowUsers devsecops
Then reload the SSH daemon:

sudo systemctl reload sshd
✅ 3.2 Add Public Key for devsecops
Log in as devsecops and create .ssh directory:

su - devsecops
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
Paste your public key into ~/.ssh/authorized_keys:

nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
4. 🧼 Remove Unnecessary Packages and Services
# List active services
sudo systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running

# Disable unneeded services (example)
sudo systemctl disable cups.service
sudo systemctl disable bluetooth.service

# Autoremove junk
sudo apt autoremove -y
5. 🔎 Inspect Running Processes
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -n 15
Understand which processes are consuming resources. You’ll use this later to detect anomalies (Week 14).

6. 🔍 Install Audit Tools
# System auditing
sudo apt update
sudo apt install auditd lynis -y

# Run baseline audit
sudo lynis audit system
✅ Verification Checklist
Task	Verified
devsecops user created with sudo	✅
/opt/notestream structure created and secured	✅
Root login disabled via SSH	✅
SSH key-based login configured	✅
Unnecessary services disabled	✅
Basic audit tools installed	✅
🧪 Run: First Security Scan
sudo lynis audit system > ~/lynis_report.txt
less ~/lynis_report.txt
Save this report. You'll compare it against future hardened states in Week 8 and Week 14.
