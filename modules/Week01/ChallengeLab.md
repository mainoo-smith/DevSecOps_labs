– Simulating a Multi-User DevSecOps System with Secure Isolation
🎯 Objective
You’ll simulate a real-world scenario where:

Multiple users (e.g., DevOps, App, and Auditor roles) exist on a shared Linux system.

Each role must have limited access, isolated permissions, and logging controls.

You’ll apply DevSecOps principles like least privilege, role separation, and secure service execution.

🧪 Scenario Setup
You’ve been asked to prepare a Linux server where:

devops_user is responsible for deploying services.

app_user runs the actual backend/frontend application processes.

auditor_user can only read logs and audit reports, but nothing else.

Each user's activities must be separated and logged.

🧱 Step 1: Create Role-Based Users and Groups
# Create groups for each role
sudo groupadd devops
sudo groupadd app
sudo groupadd auditors

# Create users and assign them
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -G devops devops_user
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -G app app_user
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -G auditors auditor_user

# Set passwords (or configure SSH keys)
sudo passwd devops_user
sudo passwd app_user
sudo passwd auditor_user
🗄️ Step 2: Prepare App Directory Access Control
Create application directories and apply strict permissions.

sudo mkdir -p /opt/notestream/{frontend,backend,logs}

# Set group ownership
sudo chown -R app_user:app /opt/notestream/{frontend,backend}
sudo chown -R root:auditors /opt/notestream/logs

# Set permissions
sudo chmod -R 750 /opt/notestream/{frontend,backend}
sudo chmod -R 740 /opt/notestream/logs
Now:

app_user can deploy/run apps

devops_user cannot touch app runtime

auditor_user can only read logs

Test this by switching users:

su - auditor_user
ls /opt/notestream/backend         # should fail
ls /opt/notestream/logs            # should succeed
🔒 Step 3: Disable sudo Where Not Needed
Lock down sudo permissions so only devops_user has elevated rights:

sudo usermod -G sudo devops_user
sudo deluser app_user sudo
sudo deluser auditor_user sudo
Edit /etc/sudoers.d/devsecops-policy:

sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/devsecops-policy
Add:

devops_user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl, /usr/bin/docker
This limits devops_user to only control services or containers — not unrestricted sudo.

📋 Step 4: Setup Audit Logging for All Users
Ensure command logging is enabled system-wide:

Edit /etc/bash.bashrc and append:

export PROMPT_COMMAND='RETRN_VAL=$?;logger -p local1.notice -t bash[$$] "$(whoami) [$$]: $(history 1 | sed "s/^[ ]*[0-9]\+[ ]*//")"'
Then configure rsyslog to write local1 logs to a secure file:

echo 'local1.*    /var/log/command_audit.log' | sudo tee /etc/rsyslog.d/90-audit.conf
sudo systemctl restart rsyslog
Now, all terminal commands will be logged per user.

🧪 Bonus Hardening Task (Optional)
Set a restricted shell for auditor_user so they can only run less, cat, and grep.

sudo apt install rssh
sudo chsh -s /usr/bin/rssh auditor_user
