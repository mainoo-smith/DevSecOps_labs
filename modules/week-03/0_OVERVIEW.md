## 🗝️ Analogy

Think of Git like Google Docs version history for code —  
- **Branches** are separate drafts you work on.  
- **Commits** are snapshots you can roll back to.  
- **Merges** are combining changes back to the main doc.  
It lets teams collaborate without overwriting each other’s work.
