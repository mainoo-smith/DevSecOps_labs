📁 Week03/Overview.md – Secure Containerization & DevSecOps Docker Practices

⸻

🧠 Module Theory: Why Container Security is a DevSecOps Priority

Containers solve consistency and scalability — but they don’t automatically solve security.

In DevSecOps, you must ensure that every image, container, and runtime process adheres to security best practices:
	•	No root user inside containers
	•	No leaked secrets in layers
	•	Base images are minimal and patched
	•	Containers follow least privilege principles
	•	Images are scanned automatically in CI/CD

A vulnerable container is a portable backdoor.

⸻

🎯 Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

✅ Containerize both the frontend (Node.js) and backend (Python) services
✅ Write secure, minimal Dockerfiles using best practices
✅ Scan containers for CVEs and security misconfigurations
✅ Inject environment variables securely (without secrets baked into images)
✅ Apply Linux capabilities and runtime flags to reduce container privileges
✅ Prepare both images for CI/CD deployment into ECS or Kubernetes

📦 Application Evolution

We will:
	•	Build two Docker images for your notestream project:
	•	frontend: Node.js + Express
	•	backend: Python + Flask
	•	Harden both Dockerfiles:
	•	Use official slim base images
	•	Avoid root
	•	Multi-stage builds (for Node.js)
	•	Introduce container runtime security:
	•	--read-only, --no-new-privileges, --cap-drop
	•	Set up docker-compose for local orchestration
	•	Introduce image scanning with Trivy or Grype

This is the first step toward ECS and Kubernetes deployment (Weeks 5–6).

⸻

🔧 Tools & Technologies
	•	Docker CLI & Docker Compose
	•	Trivy – container vulnerability scanner
	•	Grype – alternative CVE scanner
	•	Dive – explore image layers
	•	Container runtime flags: --user, --cap-drop, --read-only

🛡️ DevSecOps Concepts Introduced

Concept	Role in DevSecOps
Secure Dockerfiles	Prevent CVE propagation and root access inside containers
Image scanning in CI/CD	Shift-left security feedback
Secrets separation	Avoid hardcoded API keys, tokens
Runtime hardening	Least privilege at container execution
Supply chain security	Secure what you build and run


⸻

🔁 Dev → Sec → Ops Integration

Stage	Activity
Dev	Write secure Dockerfile, avoid root, inject configs via env vars
Sec	Scan images for vulnerabilities, use Snyk/Trivy/Grype
Ops	Enforce runtime restrictions, log activity, prepare for orchestrator


⸻

📁 Deliverables
	•	Dockerfile.frontend and Dockerfile.backend
	•	docker-compose.yml to orchestrate both
	•	Trivy/Grype scan reports
	•	Hardened docker run flags and documentation
	•	container-policy.md describing runtime
