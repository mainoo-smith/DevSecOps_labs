# 📁 Week 03: Reflection – Lessons from Container Security & Preparing for Secure Orchestration

---

### 🔁 What You Accomplished This Week

* ✅ Built and hardened **Docker images** for the notestream frontend (Node.js) and backend (Python).
* ✅ Enforced **DevSecOps principles** at the container level — including image scanning, runtime hardening, and secure Dockerfiles.
* ✅ Implemented **non-root containers**, read-only filesystems, and dropped Linux capabilities.
* ✅ Explored the **container supply chain threat model**, including CVEs, dependency drift, and tampered base images.
* ✅ Learned how to **sign, verify, and scan** images in CI/CD.

You now have production-ready container images, hardened and ready for orchestration.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways

| Concept | Real-World Importance |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Secure Dockerfiles** | Prevent common CVEs and misconfigurations at build time. |
| **Image scanning** | Detect vulnerabilities before pushing to production. |
| **Runtime hardening** | Enforce defense-in-depth, even if a container is compromised. |
| **Supply chain integrity** | Ensures you trust everything your app runs on. |
| **CI/CD integration** | Security checks must be automated and shifted left. |

### 🧰 DevSecOps Reality: “Containers ≠ Security by Default”

Many teams think Docker “isolates” services automatically—but in reality:

* Containers share the **host kernel**.
* Running as **root** inside the container can mean root on the host.
* Misconfigured Dockerfiles or leaked `.env` files are common.
* Unverified base images are open doors for supply chain attacks.

DevSecOps fixes this by treating container security as part of the SDLC, not an afterthought.

### 🧩 ECS / Kubernetes Preparation

Now that your app is containerized, here’s how these concepts carry forward to orchestration:

| Concept | In ECS/K8s |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Secure Dockerfile** | Forms the base of every container task or pod. |
| **Hardened runtime** | Enforced with ECS Task Definitions or Kubernetes Pod Security Policies/Standards. |
| **Image scanning** | Can be automated via registries (ECR, GHCR) or admission controllers. |
| **Image signing** | Enforced using tools like Kyverno, OPA Gatekeeper, or Sigstore. |
| **Secrets separation** | ECS Secrets Manager or K8s Secrets inject secrets at runtime, not baked into images. |

### 🧭 App Evolution Summary (Week 3)

| Layer | What Changed |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Code** | Separated frontend/backend, created independent runtimes. |
| **Network** | Still local via Docker Compose, port-mapped (will be isolated in ECS/K8s). |
| **Container** | Secure Dockerfiles, hardened runtime, no root, slim base image. |
| **Security** | CI-ready for Trivy/Grype scanning, image signatures supported. |
| **CI/CD** | Prepared for GitLab/GitHub pipelines next week. |

---

### ✅ Exit Criteria for Week 3

| Item | Complete |
| :--- | :--- |
| Frontend + backend Dockerfiles | ✅ |
| Image scans run and CVEs remediated | ✅ |
| Hardened runtime settings | ✅ |
| Docker Compose orchestration working | ✅ |
| `container-policy.md` + `image-hardening-summary.md` written | ✅ |
