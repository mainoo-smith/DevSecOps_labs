# Reflection – Week 2

### ✍️ Journal Your Experience

- Did you feel comfortable navigating Linux via terminal?
- How confident are you in creating a new Linux user from scratch?
- What security setting surprised you or felt critical?
- What would you automate next time?

---

### 💡 Hint:
Use the scripts and hardened machine from this week to provision your staging environment in later weeks.

Also: Think about how Ansible or Terraform could automate what you just did by hand.
