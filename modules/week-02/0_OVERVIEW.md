# 📅 Week 2 — Linux & OS Essentials (Beginner → Advanced)

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Master Linux basics: files, users, permissions.
- Use the CLI confidently for day-to-day tasks.
- Secure SSH access with best practices.
- **Advanced**:
  - System monitoring & troubleshooting (`ps`, `top`, `htop`, `journalctl`).
  - Automate tasks with cron.
  - Write reusable shell scripts with logging & error handling.
  - Harden a Linux server (fail2ban, ufw, SSH configs).
  - Audit users & processes for real-world compliance.

## 🔍 5W1H

- **Who**: DevOps engineers, SysAdmins, SREs — anyone managing Linux systems.
- **What**: OS-level control means you can fix or automate anything.
- **When**: Every time you run apps, containers, or cloud VMs.
- **Where**: Local dev, cloud VMs, container base images, CI/CD runners.
- **Why**: Linux powers 90% of servers — production troubleshooting happens here.
- **How**: Learn by doing real tasks with real config files.

## 🏗️ Real Project Context

You’ll build and secure a base Linux server template:
- This will be your **golden image** for cloud instances (Week 5).
- You’ll use these skills to build Docker base images (Week 7).
- You’ll automate these setups with Ansible/Terraform (Week 11).

## 🗝️ Analogy

A Linux server is like the kitchen of your restaurant:
- Directories = pantries
- Users = chefs
- Permissions = who can touch what ingredients
- Logs = your CCTV & receipts
- Hardening = locks on the doors & cameras

## ✅ Outcomes

By the end of this week:
- SSH securely into servers with keys.
- Harden the OS against common attacks.
- Use monitoring tools to troubleshoot real issues.
- Automate repeat tasks with cron & scripts.
