# 🌍 Week 2: Git Version Control — Real-World Scenario

## Scenario
You’ve joined a team that deploys code to production every day.
You must:
- Manage code safely with version control.
- Avoid conflicts with other developers.
- Keep secrets out of the repository.
- Write clear commit messages.

## Why This Matters
Version control is the backbone of DevSecOps — every pipeline starts here.
Mistakes (like committing secrets) can break production or cause security leaks.

## Your Outcome This Week
✅ Initialize and configure a Git repo  
✅ Commit, branch, merge, and resolve conflicts  
✅ Use `.gitignore` correctly  
✅ Use signed commits (optional) for security  
✅ Reflect on secure practices for secrets
