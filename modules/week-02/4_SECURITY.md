# 🔒 Week 2 Security — Secure the OS Layer

## Key Principles (5W1H)
- **Who** is responsible? You & your team — shared responsibility.
- **What** must be secured? Accounts, SSH, firewall.
- **When** to secure? During provisioning — “Shift Left”!
- **Where** does this apply? Cloud, local VMs, containers.
- **Why**? Misconfigurations = breach risk.
- **How**? Automate security best practices.

## Tips
- No root SSH login.
- SSH keys only.
- Keep OS updated.
- Least privilege access.

## Analogy
Securing Linux is like changing default door locks & giving keys only to those who really need them.
