📁 Week02/ChallengeLab.md – Simulating and Mitigating Lateral Movement & Misconfigured Access

⸻

🎯 Objective

In this challenge, you’ll:
	1.	Intentionally misconfigure the backend to simulate a real-world vulnerability (accidental port exposure).
	2.	Scan and exploit that exposure like an attacker would.
	3.	Detect and mitigate the misconfiguration using firewall and system hardening.

This mimics what happens when:
	•	A microservice is deployed with incorrect ingress rules
	•	Developers accidentally expose internal APIs
	•	Attackers discover lateral paths inside a compromised environment

⸻

🔧 Step 1: Simulate the Misconfiguration

Update the Python backend so it listens on all interfaces, not just localhost.

Edit /opt/notestream/backend/api.py:

app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)

Restart the backend:

python3 api.py

Test it locally first:

curl http://localhost:5000/data  # ✅ still works

Now simulate an external attacker from a second machine (or different user on same network/VM):

nmap -sS <target-ip>
curl http://<target-ip>:5000/data

You should now see:
	•	Port 5000 open to the world 🌍
	•	Backend service reachable publicly

⸻

🕵️ Step 2: Detect the Exposure Like a Defender

Check logs, open ports, and network activity:

sudo ss -tuln | grep 5000
# You should see: 0.0.0.0:5000

sudo lsof -i :5000

journalctl -u ufw
sudo grep -i "ufw" /var/log/syslog


⸻

🔐 Step 3: Patch the Misconfiguration

There are 2 fixes — try both.

✅ Fix 1: Bind only to localhost

Edit /opt/notestream/backend/api.py back to:

app.run(host='127.0.0.1', port=5000)

Restart and verify:

ss -tuln | grep 5000
# Should show: 127.0.0.1:5000

✅ Fix 2: Enforce with Firewall

If for some reason the service must bind to all interfaces (e.g., for container mesh), block external access using UFW:

sudo ufw deny in on eth0 to any port 5000

Replace eth0 with your actual interface if different (ip a to check).

⸻

🧪 Bonus: Block All But Frontend Access

Let’s pretend frontend is running as its own user on 127.0.0.1:3000 and the only service allowed to hit port 5000.

Simulate loopback-only allow rule:

sudo ufw deny 5000/tcp
sudo ufw allow in on lo to any port 5000

Test:

curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/data   # ✅ should work
curl http://<external-ip>:5000   # ❌ should fail


⸻

📋 Post-Mortem Write-Up

Create a file called misconfiguration-lesson.md with:
	•	Root cause of the exposure
	•	How it was detected
	•	How it was mitigated
	•	Recommendation for CI/CD firewall checks (hint: automate ss, nmap, ufw checks before deploy)
