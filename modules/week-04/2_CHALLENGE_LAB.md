# ðŸš€ Week 4 Challenge â€” Build & Promote Like a Pro

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Produce a versioned, signed artifact, then promote it through environments.

---

## Real Project Context

Your microservice backend needs repeatable versioning so staging always mirrors production. Youâ€™ll sign builds, push to Nexus, and promote them instead of rebuilding from source.

---

## Advanced Step

- Implement build caching: configure your local Maven or npm cache and test speed difference.
- Document the impact.

âœ… Publish a small doc: `week4/promotion-workflow.md`.

âœ… Share your artifact checksum.
