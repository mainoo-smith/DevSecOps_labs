# 📁 Week04/Overview.md – Building Secure CI/CD Pipelines for Containers (GitLab, GitHub, CodePipeline)

---

## 🧠 Module Theory: Why CI/CD is a DevSecOps Control Plane

In DevSecOps, **CI/CD pipelines** are more than automation scripts — they are **security policy enforcement engines**.

A well-secured CI/CD pipeline:

* Prevents vulnerable or unsigned images from being deployed
* Enforces linting, scanning, and policy checks before approval
* Adds auditability to every release
* Stops misconfigured infrastructure or container specs from reaching production

Your CI/CD pipeline is your first and last line of defense before things go live.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

* ✅ Build automated pipelines for Docker-based microservices
* ✅ Use **GitHub Actions** and **GitLab CI** to:
    * Build and tag images
    * Run Trivy/Grype scans
    * Enforce signature and CVE thresholds
    * Push to AWS ECR or GitLab Container Registry
* ✅ Integrate **AWS CodePipeline** for secure release automation
* ✅ Gate releases based on scan results and signature validation

---

## 📦 Application Evolution

We'll build CI/CD workflows for both the frontend (Node.js) and backend (Python) services.

Each will follow a secure pipeline that:

* ✅ Lints the Dockerfile and code
* ✅ Builds and tags a Docker image
* ✅ Scans the image with Trivy
* ✅ Signs the image with cosign
* ✅ Pushes it to the container registry
* ✅ Stores SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) as an artifact
* ❌ Blocks deploy if any **CRITICAL CVEs** are detected or image is unsigned

## 🔧 Tools & Platforms

| Platform                  | Role                                     |
| :------------------------ | :--------------------------------------- |
| **GitHub Actions** | For GitHub-hosted source code CI/CD      |
| **GitLab CI/CD** | For GitLab-native end-to-end pipelines   |
| **AWS CodePipeline** + CodeBuild | For release to AWS ECS securely          |
| **Trivy, Grype** | For image and Dockerfile scanning        |
| **cosign** | Image signing and verification           |
| **Docker, docker-compose** | Local testing and build previews         |
| **ECR, GitLab Container Registry** | Secure image storage                     |

## 🛡️ DevSecOps Concepts Introduced

| Concept                    | Purpose                                                         |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Secure Build Pipelines** | Prevent vulnerable images from being published                  |
| **CVE Threshold Enforcement** | Block deploy if image is unsafe                                 |
| **Image Signing** | Prevent tampered images in production                           |
| **SBOM Generation** | Document image contents for audit/compliance                    |
| **CI/CD Policy Shifting Left** | Make security a deploy-time gate, not an afterthought           |

## 🔁 Dev → Sec → Ops Integration

| Stage | DevSecOps Practice                                    |
| :---- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dev** | Pushes code that triggers pipeline                    |
| **Sec** | Pipeline scans image, checks Dockerfile, verifies signatures |
| **Ops** | Pulls only verified images to deploy, based on branch or tag |

---

## 📁 Deliverables

* `.gitlab-ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/docker-secure.yml`
* Trivy scan results as artifacts
* SBOM file (CycloneDX or Syft format)
* Cosign signature and verification step
* AWS ECR login + push steps
* Conditional deploy logic (if scan passes and image is signed)
