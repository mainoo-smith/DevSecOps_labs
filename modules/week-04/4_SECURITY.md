# ðŸ”’ Week 4 Security â€” Securing the Supply Chain

## Key Points

- Use GPG signing for critical artifacts.
- Verify checksums after each build.
- Lock dependencies: use `package-lock.json` or `pom.xml` with explicit versions.
- Automate dependency scans with Trivy or Snyk.

## Analogy

A signed artifact is like a sealed, tamper-evident delivery.  
If the seal is broken â€” donâ€™t trust it.
