Title: “Catch Me If You Can: CI/CD Incidents and Security Enforcement”

🧠 Scenario
Your company has CI/CD pipelines for its Python backend, Node.js frontend, and infrastructure (Terraform/CDK).
This week, the following events occur:

Incident	Description
🔥 Secret pushed to Git	A dev commits AWS credentials by mistake
❌ Insecure Terraform Merge	A team member bypasses security group validation
🐛 Vulnerable container built	Outdated image with CVEs is pushed
🚫 Deployment to UAT from wrong branch	A feature from dev accidentally gets to UAT
🌀 Drift between ECR and deployed task	Deployed version differs from tagged artifact
🤖 Developer tries to deploy manually from laptop	Bypassing CI/CD — no traceability
Your job is to simulate, detect, and block these before they cause damage.

🧪 Challenge 1: Secret Leak in Git Commit
Step 1: Simulate the Mistake
echo 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=abcd1234' >> backend/.env
git add backend/.env
git commit -m "oops: testing db fix"
Step 2: Run Gitleaks Manually
gitleaks detect --source .
✅ You should see output like:

Secret detected: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
🎯 Fail the pipeline on this detection.

Step 3: Add Gitleaks to CI
GitHub:

- name: Secrets Scan
  uses: zricethezav/gitleaks-action@v2
GitLab:

secrets:
  stage: scan
  script:
    - gitleaks detect --source .
🔥 Challenge 2: Insecure Terraform Code Merged
Step 1: Add Misconfig
In infrastructure/terraform/ecs.tf, add:

resource "aws_security_group_rule" "bad_rule" {
  type        = "ingress"
  from_port   = 0
  to_port     = 65535
  protocol    = "tcp"
  cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  security_group_id = aws_security_group.main.id
}
Step 2: Checkov Should Detect This
checkov -d infrastructure/terraform
✅ Output:

[CKV_AWS_260] Security group allows unrestricted ingress from 0.0.0.0/0
Step 3: Enforce in CI
Block the merge unless checkov passes.

- name: Checkov Scan
  run: checkov -d infrastructure/terraform
🐳 Challenge 3: Vulnerable Image Gets Deployed
Step 1: Build Image with Vulnerable Package
In Dockerfile:

FROM python:3.8
RUN pip install flask==1.0.0
Flask 1.0.0 has known CVEs

Step 2: Run Trivy Locally
trivy image backend:vuln
✅ You should see:

[HIGH] Flask 1.0.0 has XX vulnerabilities...
Step 3: Enforce in CI
Add to pipeline:

- name: Trivy Image Scan
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  with:
    image-ref: backend:${{ github.sha }}
    severity: HIGH,CRITICAL
    exit-code: 1
🛡️ If HIGH or CRITICAL CVEs are found, the job fails.

🌀 Challenge 4: Wrong Branch Deployed to UAT
Step 1: Simulate Branch Confusion
A dev merges a feature to dev, but QA approves it accidentally into uat.

Step 2: Validate ref Before Deploying
Update CI job to block unauthorized deploy:

if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/uat' && contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[uat-approved]')
🔐 Tag or annotate commits to uat with required approvals.

🧾 Challenge 5: ECR Image != Deployed Version
Step 1: Push Image
docker build -t backend:v1.2.0 .
docker push <ecr>/backend:v1.2.0
Step 2: Deploy Incorrectly Tagged Task
Manually deploy the wrong image version (v1.0.0).

Step 3: Add ECR Drift Check Job
Use ECR CLI or script:

aws ecs describe-tasks ... | jq '.[] | .containers[].image' 
Compare with Git tag or commit hash.

✅ Add pipeline check:

if deployed_image != tagged_artifact:
   echo "Drift detected!"
   exit 1
👨‍💻 Challenge 6: Manual Deploy from Dev Machine
Step 1: Simulate
Run terraform apply or aws ecs update-service directly from a dev laptop.

Step 2: Catch Unauthorized Role Use
Use AWS CloudTrail to log role usage:

aws cloudtrail lookup-events --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=Username,AttributeValue=DevUser
✅ This should alert if deploys bypass CI OIDC or IAM roles.

✅ Checklist
Incident	Tool	Detection
Secrets in Git	Gitleaks	Pre-commit, CI scan
Insecure IaC	Checkov, tfsec	Fail merge
Vulnerable containers	Trivy	Fail build
Wrong env promotion	Git branch policy	Tag validation
Artifact drift	ECS + ECR compare	Alert and rollback
Manual deploys	IAM Role usage + CloudTrail	Alert and block
🏁 You now understand how to simulate and guard against the most common real-world CI/CD incidents.
