This is a test module for learning DevSecOps by simulating real-world scenarios using real tools. 
To use this repo, you can fork it, clone it, or create an issue from a PR. 
The project comes with scripts that can be run locally or on any VM.
You can play around with the commands, break things, and fix them to reinforce learning.

The project is divided into modules by week. Every week has an overview, guided labs, challenge lab, reflection, security considerations, and expected outcome.
After completing each lab/task, you can create an issue and add it to the corresponding project to track your progress.

Enjoy!!!
